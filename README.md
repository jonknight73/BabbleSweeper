# BabbleSweeper

**This code is under development and you are using it at your own risk**

----

## How to Play

Open the app and press the play icon to start the game.

//TODO Here we will discuss starting a babble node. But as the babble node is not integrated in the
code yet, we will discuss that afterwards.

//TODO Here we assume that we have more than one player and we have started the game.

When you start the game, there is a X by Y grid (//TODO put the grid size in here). Your aim is to
claim as much territory as possible. Unfortunately the fog of war has descended and we do not know
what the other players are up to. The boffins have been hard at work and have come up with a gadget
to help you. It shows the number of occupied neighbouring squares.
